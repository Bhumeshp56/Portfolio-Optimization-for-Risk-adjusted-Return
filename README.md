This project aims to study the construction of a portfolio composed of five stocks Reliance, Tata consultancy services, HDFC bank, ICICI bank, Infosys and the NIfty 50 stock index, all listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE India). This study aims to minimize the risk associated with this portfolio by using portfolio management techniques.

The importance of portfolio management lies in finding a balance between expected return and risk. Volatility, which measures the dispersion of an asset's returns, is often used to measure risk. On the other hand, expected return represents the average expected return on an asset. Analyzing the relationship between volatility and expected return will improve our Performance.

In this context, we will examine different portfolio compositions, adjusting the investment proportions in each asset. The objective is to find the optimal combination that minimises the portfolio's overall risk while maximising the expected return. We will use concepts such as covariance and the correlation coefficient between asset returns to do this. Particular attention will be paid to the effect of correlations between asset returns on the portfolio's risk level. The correlation coefficient reflects the extent to which asset returns move together. We will study how the correlation between the selected stocks and NIFTY50 index can influence the portfolio's overall risk.

To conduct this study, we will use the Python programming language and Jupyter Notebook in particular, which offers a range of tools and libraries for financial analysis and portfolio management. Using Python, we can perform volatility, covariance, and portfolio optimisation calculations to find the optimal composition that minimises risk.

In conclusion, this project will allow us to explore the fundamental concepts of portfolio management by studying the construction of a portfolio composed of Five stocks and a stock index. We will minimise risk using quantitative analysis and optimisation techniques while maximising expected return. Analysing the effect of correlations between asset returns will allow us to understand better the impact of diversification on the portfolio's risk level.
